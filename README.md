# user_preference_modeling

Multiple ways to model user preference in recommender systems

Modeling the preference of the user as an input to the retrieval or ranking model has been a successful strategy in recommender systems. The conventional approach is using an embedding table lookup. We will also look at the schematic of an implementation using Deep Hash Embeddings. Then we will look at a middle ground.

## Testing

Run `pytest tests/*` from main directory.
